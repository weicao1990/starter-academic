I am currently a senior researcher at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), Machine Learning Group, headed by Prof. [Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/). I received my Ph.D. degree from Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. [Jian Li](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/). Before that, I received the B. Sc degree from Department of Computer Science at Wuhan University in 2013.

I have a wide range of research interests on applied machine learning, including Quantitive Trading, Intelligent Health-Care, Logistics Optimization etc. In the past years, we co-worked with many leading companies in various fields to explore the opportunities of AI in the corresponding scenarios, including China-AMC, Shunfeng Tech, Humana and Sanofi, etc.

***HIRING***: I am seeking for self-motived interns who have interests on time series, tabular data and autoML. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
